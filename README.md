# Lash or Dye

A friend of mine, starting her own business approached me and wanted me to help create a website. For the purpose of time we've
opted to purchase a theme and edit as needed.

This will be a full stack project with a database that will contain sensitive customer information and customer profiles. (ph#s, medical
history as well). I'l intergrate either MySQL or Mongo for housing of the data. 

The theme's front end is built with simple HTML/CSS. 

More to come
